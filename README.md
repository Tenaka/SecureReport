#TPM and Bitlocker
"TPM and Bitlocker protect against offline attack from usb and mounting the local Windows system then accessing the local data. 'TPM and Pin' enhances Bitlocker by preventing LPC Bus (Low Pin Count) bypasses of Bitlocker with TPM.

#Secure Boot
Secure Boot is a security standard to ensure only trusted OEM software is allowed at boot. At startup, the UEFi and boot software's digital signatures are validated preventing rootkits

#VBS
Virtualization-based security (VBS), isolates core system resources to create secure regions of memory. Enabling VBS allows for Hypervisor-Enforced Code Integrity (HVCI), Device Guard and Credential Guard.

#Hypervisor Enforced Code Integrity
Hypervisor Enforced Code Integrity prevents the loading of unsigned kernel-mode drivers and system binaries from being loaded into system memory.
Further information can be found @  
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/device-guard/enable-virtualization-based-protection-of-code-integrity

#Security Options
Prevent credential relay with Impacket and Man in the Middle by Digitally Signing for SMB and LDAP connections enforcement.
Further information can be found @
https://www.tenaka.net/smb-relay-attack

#LSA
Enabling RunAsPPL for LSA Protection allows only digitally signed binaries to load as a protected process preventing credential theft and access by code injection and memory access by processes that aren’t signed.
Further information can be found @ https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/credentials-protection-and-management/configuring-additional-lsa-protection

#DLL Safe Search
When applications do not fully qualify the DLL path and instead allow searching the default behaviour is for the ‘Current Working Directory’ to be called, then system paths. This allows an easy route to call malicious DLL’s. Setting ‘DLL Safe Search’ mitigates the risk by moving CWD to later in the search order.
Further information can be found @
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-search-order

#DLL Hijacking (Permissions)
DLL Hijacking is when a malicious dll replaces a legitimate dll due to a path vulnerability. A program or service makes a call on that dll gaining the privileges of that program or service. Additionally missing dll’s presents a risk where a malicious dll is dropped into a path where no current dll exists but the program or service is making a call to that non-existent dll.
This audit is reliant on programs being launched so that DLL’s are loaded. Each process’s loaded dll’s are checked for permissions issues and whether they are signed.  
The DLL hijacking audit does not currently check for missing dll’s being called. Process Monitor filtered for ‘NAME NOT FOUND’ and path ends with ‘DLL’ will.


#Automatically Elevate User
Auto Elevate User is a setting that elevates users allowing them to install software without being an administrator. 

#Password in Files
Searches the following locations:
C:\Users\
C:\ProgramData\
C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\
C:\Windows\Panther\
C:\Windows\system32\
C:\Windows\system32\sysprep

Searches the following file extensions:
txt, ini, .xml

For the following words:
password, credential

Ignore these files as they contain the word 'Password' by default:
C:\Windows\system32\NarratorControlTemplates.xml
C:\Windows\system32\DDFs\NGCProDDF_v1.2_final.xml
C:\Windows\system32\icsxml\ipcfg.xml
C:\Windows\system32\icsxml\pppcfg.xml
C:\Windows\system32\slmgr\0409\slmgr.ini
C:\Windows\system32\winrm\0409\winrm.ini
​
#Password embedded in Processes
Processes that contain credentials to authenticate and access applications. Launching Task Manager, Details and add ‘Command line’ to the view.
​
#AutoLogon
Checks "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\Currentversion\Winlogon" for any clear text credentials remaining from a MECM\SCCM\MDT deployment.

#Unquoted
The Unquoted Path vulnerability is when a Windows Service's 'Path to Executable' contains spaces and is not wrapped in double-quotes providing a route to System.
Further information can be found @
https://www.tenaka.net/unquotedpaths

#Legacy Network Protocols
LLMNR and other legacy network protocols can be used to steal password hashes.

#Permissions Weakness in Default System Directories - Write
System default Folders that allow a User the Write permissions. These can be abused by creating content in some of the allowable default locations. Prevent by applying Execution controls eg Applocker.

Searches:
C:\PerfLogs
C:\Program Files
C:\Program Files (x86)
C:\Windows

Expected folders that a user can Write to:
C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\WMI
C:\Windows\System32\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys
C:\Windows\System32\Tasks
C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\Microsoft\Windows\RemoteApp and Desktop Connections Update
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Tasks
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Tasks\Microsoft\Windows\RemoteApp and Desktop Connections Update
C:\Windows\tracing

#Permissions Weakness in Default System Directories - Create Files
System default Folders that allow a User the CreateFile permissions. These can be abused by creating content in some of the allowable default locations. Prevent by applying Execution controls eg Applocker.

Expected folders that a user can CreateFiles to:
C:\Windows\PLA\Reports
C:\Windows\PLA\Reports\en-GB
C:\Windows\PLA\Reports\en-US
C:\Windows\PLA\RulesC:\Windows\PLA\Rules\en-GB
C:\Windows\PLA\Rules\en-US

#Permissions weaknesses in Non-Default Directories
A vulnerability exists when enterprise software has been installed on the root of C:\. The default permissions allow a user to replace approved software binaries with malicious binaries.
Further information can be found @
https://www.tenaka.net/unquotedpaths

#Files that are Writeable
System files that allow users to write can be swapped out for malicious software binaries.

Further information can be found @
https://www.tenaka.net/unquotedpaths

#Firewalls
Firewalls should always block inbound and exceptions should be to a named IP and Port.

#Scheduled Tasks
Checks for Scheduled Tasks excluding any that reference System32 as a directory. 
These potential user-created tasks are checked for scripts and their directory permissions are validated. 
No user should be allowed to access the script and make amendments, this is a privilege escalation route.

Checks for encoded scripts, PowerShell or exe's that make calls off box or run within Task Scheduler.

#Shares
Finds all shares and reports on share permissions
Does not show IPC$ and permissions due to access issues.

#Driver Query Signing
All Drivers should be signed with a digital signature to verify the integrity of the packages. 64bit kernel Mode drivers must be signed without exception

#Authenticode Hash Mismatch
Checks that digitally signed files have a valid and trusted hash. If any Hash Mis-Matches then the file could have been altered
